    LEO Drag Force Model

    Returns a drag force using [any atmospheric model] that accounts for the atmospheric LEO drag that 
    SAL-E will experience after being deployed at 510km altitude.

    *note: orekit has existing drag force models and LEO atmospheric density models that can be used
    within the script. 


    Inputs:
        - reference frame (should be in ECEF)
        - atmospheric model

    Outputs:
        -
